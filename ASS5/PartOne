The Command
    ssh -L <local port>:<local host>:<target port> <target host>
allows a secure communication between client and host.
Assuming
    1) the Server is listening on <target host> at <target port>
    2) the Client connects to <local host> at <local port>
    3) "AllowTcpForwarding true" is set in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Example:
    ssh -L 12345:localhost:2015 localhost
        Server running on localhost port 2015
        Client connects to localhost port 12345
